# Can I Recycle It?

**Live URL:** https://www.canirecycleit.org/

This is a basic React app I created to quickly and more easily search for whether certain materials are recyclable or not in Denver. 

All of the data is from [Denver County's website](https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Recycle-Compost-Trash/Recycle#section-3),but this is not regularly maintained. Be sure to check your local laws for the most up-to-date information.
